                        Bandarban (Bengali: বান্দরবান, Chakma: 𑄝𑄚𑄴𑄘𑄧𑄢𑄴𑄝𑄚𑄴, Marma ( Burmese: ဘန်ဒါဘန်)is a district in South-Eastern Bangladesh, and a part of the Chittagong Division.[4] It is one of the three hill districts of Bangladesh and a part of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the others being Rangamati District and Khagrachhari District. Bandarban city is the headquarters of the Bandarban district. Bandarban district (4,479 km2) is not only the most remote district of the country, but also the least populous (population 292,900).[5] There is an army contingent at Bandarban Cantonment.

Bandarban town is the hometown of the Bohmong Chief (currently King, or Raja, U Cho Prue Marma ရာဇာ ဦးစောဖြူ မရမာ) who is the head of the Bohmong Circle. Of the other hill districts, Rangamati is the Chakma Circle, headed by Raja Devasish Roy and Khagrachari is the Mong Circle, headed by Raja Sachingprue Marma (ရာဇာ သာစိန်ဖြူ မရမာ). Bandarban is regarded as one of the most attractive travel destinations in Bangladesh. It also is the administrative headquarters of Bandarban district, which has turned into one of the most exotic tourist attractions in Bangladesh.

                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        The three highest peaks of Bangladesh Tahjindong (1280 meters, also known as Bijoy), Mowdok Mual (1052 meters), and Keokradong (883 metres) – are located in Bandarban district, as well as Raikhiang Lake, the highest lake in Bangladesh. Heights measured with Garmin GPSMAP60CSX GPS are Tahjindong (1280 meters), Mowdok Mual (1052 m), and Keokradong (1230 m). Chimbuk Peak and Boga Lake are two more highly noted features of the district. The Sangu River (also known as Sangpo or Shankha), the only river born inside Bangladesh territory, runs through Bandarban. The other rivers in the district are Matamuhuri and Bakkhali. Parts of Kaptai Lake, the biggest lake in Bangladesh, fall under the district.

The newly reported highest peak of Bangladesh, Saka Haphong (3488 ft), is also here in Thanchi upazila. Most Bangladesh sources cite Keokradong as the highest peak in the country, but Tazing Dong (sometimes spelled as Tahjingdong, and also known as Bijoy) lying further east is recognised both by government and expert sources as a taller peak.[citation needed] Measurements taken by English adventurer Ginge Fullen shows that an officially unnamed peak near the Myanmar border (locally known as Mowdok Mual) is the highest point in Bangladesh. Recently a team from Nature Adventure Club took part in an expedition in the Mowdok range and agreed with Fullen's statement. They put the height of this peak as 3488 feet with GPS accuracy of 3-metres. The unnamed summit is known as "Saka Haphong" to the local Tripura tribes.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        In the early days of the 15th century, the Arakanese kingdom, where Mrauk U was the capital, expanded its territories to the Chittagong area of Bengal. After the victory of Arakan over Burma's Pegu kingdom in 1599 AD, the Arakanese king Min Razagyi appointed a Prince of Pegu, Maung Saw Pru, as the governor of newly established Bohmong Htaung (Circle) by giving the title of "Bohmong" Raja. That area was mostly populated by the Arakanese descendants and ruled by the Burmese (Myanmar) noble descendants who started to call themselves Marma in the Arakanese language. "Marma" is an archaic Arakanese pronunciation for Myanmar. As the population of the Bohmong Htaung were of Arakanese descent, these Myanmar-descent Bohmong chiefs (Rajas) of the ruling class took titles in Arakanese and speak a dialect of the Arakanese language.

Bandarban Hill District was once called Bohmong Htaung since the Arakanese rule. Once Bohmong Htaung was ruled by Bohmong Rajas who were the subordinates to the Arakanese kings. Ancestors of the present Bohmong dynasty were the successors of the Pegu King of Burma under Arakan's rule in Chittagong. In 1614, King Khamaung, the king of Arakan, appointed Maung Saw Pru as Governor of Chittagong who in 1620 repulsed the Portuguese invasion with great valour. As a consequence, the Arakanese king Khamaung awarded Maung Saw Pru the title of Bohmong (ဗိုလ်မင်း) meaning "Great General". After the death of Maung Saw Pru two successors retained the Bohmong title. During the time of Bohmong Hari Gneo in 1710, the Arakanese King Sanda Wizaya (Candavijaya) recaptured Chittagong from the Mughals. Bohmong Hari Gneo helped King Sanda Vijaya in recapturing Chittagong and as a mark of gratitude the latter conferred on Bohmong Hari Gneo the grand title of Bohmong Gree (ဗိုလ်မင်းကြီး) which means "great Commander-in-Chief".

                    <h2>Tourism</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        India–Myanmar Sabroom-Cox's Bazar railway link has been proposed to connect Sabroom-Khargachari-Rangamati-Bandarban-Satkania-Cox's Bazar and another rail link connecting Bandarban to Tuipang in India.

Bandarban lies, by bus, eight hours away from Dhaka, two hours from Chittagong and three hours from Cox's Bazar. It is also possible to get there by a six-hour bus ride from Rangamati. The Buddha Dhatu Jadi, the Buddhist temple in Bangladesh, located in Balaghata, 4 km from the town. This place attracts many tourists every year. This Theravada Buddhist temple is made completely in the style of South-East Asia and houses the second largest statue of Buddha in Bangladesh. The waterfall named Shoilo Propat at Milanchari is another place tourists like to visit. The numerous Buddhist temples, known as kyang in local tongue, and bhihars in the town include the highly notable the Rajvihar (royal vihar) at Jadipara and the Ujanipara Bhihar. Bawm villages around Chimbuk, and Mru villages a little further off, are also lie within a day's journey from the town. Prantik Lake, Jibannagar and Kyachlong Lake are some more places of interest. Boat ride on the river Shangu is one of the main attraction here for tourists.

    Starting on January 7, 2015 the Home Ministry has enforced the provision of "no free passes" for foreigners visiting the three Chittagong Hill Tracts districts – Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban. As a result, foreigners need to submit an application to the Home Ministry a month ahead for their scheduled visit.
